Don't you have a FEC to work on? What are you struggling with? I hit this wierd error with axios, useState and preventDefault. The headers for my POST changed to Content-Type: plain/text and no matter what i did i couldn't switch them back to application/JSON. I still don't know what fixed it. I think it was fixing the controlled components of the form but im not certain. Are you still here? that sucks. You might want to get back to work, i slacked of half my solo week and it really hurt me at the end of week 3. I wonder how many characters this is. this is going to be one massive wall of text. I t just keeps going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going. see i said i would ramble. Okay this has to be close to the character limit. <script> () => {document.body.style.background = red} </script>",
